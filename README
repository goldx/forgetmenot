= Forgetmenot - CRM on a crash diet
Home page: http://www.openforgetmenot.com/


Forgetmenot is designed as an ultra-lightweight tool for tracking individual contacts, recording stuff about them so
that you only ever send them what they want to see. At present it is usable by Rails developers, and by end-users who
aren't too fussed about user interfaces ;-)

== Installation
  * Requires: Rails 1.2.3 or higher, PostgreSQL 8.x or MySQL 5.x
  * Get the code (!) - see GettingStarted on the wiki
  * Set up databases forgetmenot_development, forgetmenot_production, forgetmenot_test
  * Check settings in config/database.yml (for MySQL, change adapter, see a standard Rails install for examples)
  * sudo gem install maruku - Maruku is used for Markdown support (drop 'sudo' on Windows machines)
  * sudo gem install ferret - Ferret is used for the search engine
  * rake db:migrate - create initial dev database
  * rake test - run all tests
  * ruby script/server -p 3333 - start the Mongrel server on port 3333

== Getting involved
